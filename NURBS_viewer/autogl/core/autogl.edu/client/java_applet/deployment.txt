     Deployment of AutoGL Java applet



NOTICE:
  Java applet is based on JDK version 1.1, so IE should work.
  Mozilla may need installation of Java plug-in.
  Web server URL is hard-coded into AutoGLApplet.java




A) Deployment of Infrastructure

1. Put autogl.edu/server/rich_client_cgi/autogl_post_command.c 
   on the web server home page directory (~/public_html).

2. Compile autogl_post_command.c on the web server.
   Create CGI binary executable, autogl_post_command.cgi .

ex:  gcc -o autogl_post_command.cgi autogl_post_command.c
   
3. Compile Java applet, AutoGLApplet.java.
   Create Java class file, AutoGLApplet.class .

ex: javac AutoGLApplet.java

4. Put AutoGLApplet.class and applet_autogl.html on the web server
   home page directory.




B) Deployment of User Application

1. Compile AutoGL application as server version.
   You may need to modify Makefile to commend out "Server".
   May also need to recompile AutoGL library with the modified Makefile.
   Create server version executable (based on software emulation).

2. Put AutoGL binary executable on the web server home page directory.



C) Run

1. On the web server, run AutoGL executable.

2. From browser, access applet_autogl.html. 

ex: http://DOMAIN/~USER/applet_autogl.html
