     Deployment of AutoGL i-mode Java application (i-appli)



NOTICE:
  Java application is based on NTT DoCoMo Java, DoJa 3.5.
  So only 900i series is supported.
  Screen resolution 240x240 is assumed.
  Web server URL is hard-coded into AutoGLApplication.java



A) Deployment of Infrastructure

1. Put autogl.edu/server/rich_client_cgi/autogl_post_command.c 
   on the web server home page directory (~/public_html).

2. Compile autogl_post_command.c on the web server.
   Create CGI binary executable, autogl_post_command.cgi .

ex:  gcc -o autogl_post_command.cgi autogl_post_command.c
   
3. Compile AutoGLApplication.java using emulator on PC.
   Create JAR file, i_autogl.jar .
   Also, ADF file, i_autogl.jam .
   in the ADF file, file size of JAR file is written.

4. Send i_autogl.jar and i_autogl_jam in bin/ directory 
   of the emulator machine, to the web server home page

5. Also, put i_autogl.html on the web server home page directory.



B) Deployment of User Application

1. Compile AutoGL application as server version.
   You may need to modify Makefile to commend out "Server".
   May also need to recompile AutoGL library with the modified Makefile.
   Create server version executable (based on software emulation).

2. Put AutoGL binary executable on the web server home page directory.



C) Run

1. On the web server, run AutoGL executable.

2. From i-mode terminal, access i_autogl.html. 

ex: http://DOMAIN/~USER/i_autogl.html

3. Download i-appli, iAutoGL.

4. Run iAutoGL.
