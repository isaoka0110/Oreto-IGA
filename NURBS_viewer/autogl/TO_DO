            To Do List



<Test>

* final test before release




<Bugs>

* AutoGL

 ** transparency does not work on smooth contour

 ** contour bar of gray scale contour is too dark, 
    so indicator is not visible.
    more_sample_c/contour.c

* AutoGL OS-X

 ** edge may disappear depending on view direction 
    polygon offset is required

* AutoGL.edu 

 ** CGI access to web server is too slow in case of NFS
    NFS server synchronization problem
    CGI script writes file autogl_post_command at NFS server.
    then, it takes 10-20 seconds for remote host running AutoGL server 
    to update information of directory public_html/, 
    so fopen of file autogl_post_command in AutoGL server fail.
    type "ls" at remote host explicitly to update directory information.
    to work around this problem, 
      don't use NFS.
      run AutoGL server directly on web server.

 ** how to avoid chmod og+w public_html/ ? (FreeBSD platform)

 ** update current property status (pure redraw)
    do not send applet's property status into server
    does it mean ????

* AutoGL-MP, OS-X

  ** AutoGL_SetBatchProcessCallback

   *** how to call UpdateModel 
       use AutoGL_INSIDE_InvokeCallback ?



<Feature Enhancement>

* document 

 ** FORTRAN API reference 

 ** AutoGL OS-X manual

 ** AutoGL-MP manual

 ** AutoGL MMX manual

 ** AutoGL.edu manual

* AutoGL

 ** GUI

  *** dialog box (open/close panel window)

  *** user-defined menu item

* AutoGL.edu 

 ** AutoMT (mobile terminal ???)

 ** iAutoGL : mouse event, pick & selection

 ** HTML : no-frame, no-JavaScript version (for smart phone)

 ** synchronization among multiple clients

* OS-X tuning

* GUI -> CUI, write log file (script recording command history)

** AutoGL-MP primitive level parallelization 

* AutoVK (volume kit ???)



<Not Implemented Yet>

* AutoGL

 ** CUI

  *** resize command is not effective while command line mode
      because event handling is not working in this mode

 ** Windows platform (WIN32 + OpenGL)
 
  *** MP integration

  *** MMX integration

 ** UNIX platform (Motif + OpenGL)
 
  *** updation of choice control does not work

  *** MP integration

  *** MMX integration

 ** FORTRAN interface

  *** calling C function from FORTRAN
      small capital or large (in old system)
      single undersccore (Sun), or zero (HP)
      GNU, single underscore compilation flag

  *** autogladdstring
      how to handle null-terminated character string ?

  *** batch process callback

  *** fast rendering

  *** MP / MMX (InitializeAutoNOSim and argc, argv)

  *** Cygwin
    Ctrl-C does not work well
    kill process from task manager, or keep pressing Ctrl-C keys

* AutoGL OS-X

 ** get image is not implemented yet
    so, image save function does not work
    use "result.ppm" instead

 ** perspective view is not implemented yet

 ** transparency is not implemented yet

 ** specular is not implemented yet

 ** idle event is not implemented yet

* AutoGL MMX

 ** after synchronization, cannot resize view windows
    resize the slave view window first before synchronization 
      (within 10 seconds), later on, adjust master view window to the slave.
    or, call AutoGL_ResizeView in AutoGL_SetUp

* AutoGL-MP

 ** transparency does not work

 ** Linux/FreeBSD platform (Gtk+ + gtkglarea + OpenGL)

  *** after synchronization, cannot resize view windows
      how to deal resize event while using MPI

 ** UNIX platform (Motif + OpenGL)
 
  *** not implemted yet

 ** Windows platform (WIN32 + OpenGL)

  *** not implemted yet
      how to pass command line arguments to AutoNOSim ?
